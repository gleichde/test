##  Prerequisites

Commonly, you do not have to care about prerequisites because the package manager pip automatically install anything you need.

**BUT:** MIScnn does NOT use Tensorflow 2.0 (right now)!  
Therefore, if you have a higher Tensorflow or Keras version, please install the two modules manually with the correct version or in a separate package environment (e.g. with [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)).  

MIScnn currently only supports Tensorflow 1.13 and Keras 2.2.4.
