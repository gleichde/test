The selection of a deep learning or convolutional neural network model is the most important step in a medical image segmentation pipeline. But there is a variety of model architectures and each has different strengths and weaknesses. MIScnn features an open model interface to load and switch between provided state-of-the-art convolutional neural network models like the popular U-Net model.

Models are represented with the open-source neural network library Keras which provides an user-friendly API for commonly used neural-network building blocks on top of TensorFlow.

The already implemented models are highly configurable by definable number of neurons, custom input sizes, optional dropout and batch normalization layers or enhanced architecture versions like the Optimized High Resolution Dense-U-Net model. Additionally, MIScnn offers architectures for 3D, as well as 2D medical image segmentation.

Besides the flexibility in switching between already implemented models, the open model interface enables the ability for custom deep learning model implementations and simple integrating these custom models into the MIScnn pipeline.

## Usage of MIScnn Architectures

An Architecture can be passed to the Neural Network class initialization. The Neural Network class automatically uses provided Architecture as model.

```python
# Import desired Architecture
from miscnn.neural_network.architecture.unet.residual import Architecture

# Initialize Architecture
unet_residual = Architecture(activation="softmax")

# Pass Architecture to Neural Network Class
model = Neural_Network(preprocessor=pp, architecture=unet_residual)
```

## Available Architectures provided by MIScnn

#### Standard U-Net

The popular and state-of-the-art architecture of medical image segmentation is the standard U-Net. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization.

**Example:**

```python
